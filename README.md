Login Portal UI Testing (Java):

This repository contains UI test automation for the login portal prototype, developed using Java, Selenium, and TestNG/JUnit.



ðŸ”§ Tool Selection Rationale:
While Cypress is often preferred for frontend testing, this project adopts Java with Selenium due to:

â€¢	Smooth integration with our Eclipse-based development environment.

â€¢	Strong cross-browser testing capabilities and widespread use in enterprise QA workflows.

â€¢	A flexible, maintainable structure that supports scalable, long-term UI automation.

Alongside the automation scripts, Iâ€™ve also prepared and included comprehensive manual test cases. Creating these cases is an essential aspect of the testing lifecycle, contributing to both planning and execution. This ensures thorough coverage of the login portal's functionality and reinforces the reliability of the platform through both manual validation and automated verification.
